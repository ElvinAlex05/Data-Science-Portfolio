## 📊 Executive Summary 

Business challenge: convert messy UK online retail transactions (2010–2011; 500k+ rows) into decision-ready insight for revenue growth and customer retention. Hypothesis: revenue is concentrated in a small subset of products and customers, and RFM segmentation can surface actionable groups. Using Tableau Prep, I built a repeatable ETL flow (CustomerID validation, quantity checks, Total Price feature, description standardisation) and exported `.hyper` extracts. In Tableau Desktop, I analysed monthly revenue trends, top products, top customers, and RFM segments (Champions, Loyal, Potential, At Risk, Lost) to inform merchandising, campaign timing, and retention offers. The dashboard replaces manual spreadsheets with a single auditable view; benefits should be measured via reporting cycle-time reduction, fewer reconciliation errors, and adoption/usage. Implementation requires stakeholder walkthroughs, agreed KPI definitions, access governance, and a refresh cadence. Overall, disciplined ETL plus interpretable segmentation translates transactions into actions that improve commercial outcomes and supports sustainable change management with low cost and risk.
