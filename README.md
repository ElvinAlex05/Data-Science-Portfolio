# UK Online Retail – Data Science Portfolio Project

## 📊 Executive Summary

This data science project explores customer behaviour and product performance using the UK Online Retail dataset (2010–2011). The goal was to uncover valuable customer segments and product trends to support data-driven business decisions.

The dataset included over 500,000 transactions. Using Tableau Prep, I performed ETL to clean the data, filter UK-only transactions, and group product descriptions. An RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model was applied to segment customers, identifying groups such as “Champions” and “At Risk”.

Key tools used:
- **Tableau Prep** for data cleaning and transformation
- **Tableau Desktop** for visualisation and dashboarding

The resulting dashboard highlights:
- Top-selling products
- Customer segment breakdown
- Monthly revenue trends

This project reflects the “3 I’s” of Data Science: interaction with real-world data, iteration through data wrangling and visualisation, and independent execution of a full analytical workflow. The insights provide strategic value for improving marketing and customer retention.
